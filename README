Recap of Today's Work
Loaded the Dataset:

Loaded a nutrition dataset in CSV format for analysis.
Initial Inspection:

Checked column names and data types.
Noted columns with units included in values (e.g., "mg," "g").
Identified columns where numeric values were stored as object types due to units embedded in the data.
Data Cleaning:

Used a custom function with regex to:
Detect units in each column (like "mg" or "g").
Remove the units from values.
Rename columns to include units in the column header instead (e.g., cholesterol (mg)).
Converted cleaned values to numeric data types (float64 or int64) for easy analysis.
Verified that all columns except name were successfully converted to numeric types.
Identified Remaining Non-Numeric Columns:

After the initial cleaning, some columns like cholesterol, hydroxyproline, and various sugars (fructose, glucose, etc.) still had non-numeric values.
Implemented a targeted cleaning approach to ensure these remaining columns were fully converted to numeric.
Final Verification:

Confirmed that only the name column remained as a non-numeric object type, which is expected since it holds food names.
Next Steps for Tomorrow
Further Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Run .describe() on cleaned_data to get an overview of numeric columns.
Examine distribution of key nutrients with histograms and boxplots to understand data spread and identify outliers.
Correlation Analysis:

Generate a correlation matrix for nutrients to identify relationships between them.
Visualize correlations with a heatmap if applicable.
Top Foods Analysis:

Identify top foods based on specific nutrients (e.g., highest protein or lowest sodium).
This can provide insights into which foods are nutrient-dense.
Machine Learning Preparation (If Applicable):

Plan for machine learning features to suggest healthier meals or track daily nutrient intake.
Consider scaling or normalizing data for ML models if needed.

Project Recap and Next Steps (Date: November 1, 2024)
Project Recap
So far, we’ve completed the foundational setup for your machine learning project. Here’s a summary of what we’ve done:

Environment Setup:

Installed Python 3.10: Chose a compatible version to avoid compatibility issues with TensorFlow and other packages.
Created a Virtual Environment: Used a virtual environment to isolate project dependencies, ensuring consistent and conflict-free package versions.
Installed Essential Libraries:
pandas for data manipulation.
tensorflow for model creation and deep learning.
scikit-learn for preprocessing, splitting, and evaluating data.
Version Control:

Initialized a Git repository and committed the initial setup files (like .gitignore, environment setup).
Set up your project in a structure that is compatible with Git for version tracking and potential collaboration.
Documentation:

Created detailed Markdown documentation for the imported libraries to explain the purpose of each library and how it will support your project.
