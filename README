Project Recap and Next Steps (Date: November 1, 2024)
Project Recap
So far, we’ve completed the foundational setup for your machine learning project. Here’s a summary of what we’ve done:

Environment Setup:

Installed Python 3.10: Chose a compatible version to avoid compatibility issues with TensorFlow and other packages.
Created a Virtual Environment: Used a virtual environment to isolate project dependencies, ensuring consistent and conflict-free package versions.
Installed Essential Libraries:
pandas for data manipulation.
tensorflow for model creation and deep learning.
scikit-learn for preprocessing, splitting, and evaluating data.
Version Control:

Initialized a Git repository and committed the initial setup files (like .gitignore, environment setup).
Set up your project in a structure that is compatible with Git for version tracking and potential collaboration.
Documentation:

Created detailed Markdown documentation for the imported libraries to explain the purpose of each library and how it will support your project.
